# DuoLingoCLone
DuoLingo clone made at notjustdev with some modification : 
1. made in typescript not pure js
1. only 1 source question file
1. choice question type can have multiple choice just by adding more "correct" parameter value
1. validation button is in the app.tsx directly, validation is made with connexion between question componenent an main page.


### have been tested on an Android nexus 7 only, not on ios. should work but can't be sure. 

### there was no exception handler in the course so I only add it for the async functions.
